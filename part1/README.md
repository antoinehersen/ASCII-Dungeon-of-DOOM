# The dungeon

## Dungeon definition
Dungeons are defined in `.lvl` files. `#` represent walls, `o` the hero starting position, and `X` the treasure.

*Read the dungeon file and display it.*

## Hero action
 Using `WASD` the hero `o` should be able to move on the screen, sadly our hero lack the ability to walk through walls ...
 
 *Implement hero control.*
 
## Getting rich quick

*When the hero reach the treasure it should be congratulated!*
